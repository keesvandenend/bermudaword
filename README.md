"# bermudaword" 

This is a partial copy of the original Bermuda Word HypLern reader for older Windows versions. It is only to show the architecture that was set up to create the 44 different educational Software program executables in ISBN.txt.

The VB files contain the framework that offer the possibility of running the HTML+CSS+Javascript source in an executable, and also the plug-ins necessary to perform back-end tasks like persistency, sorting, decryption, tests ui setup or automated registration at bermudaword.com. The perl scripts respectively create a HTML browser package and encrypt that and load it into a single .exe file.

The base directory contains some of the necessary scripts and html files. The language directory would contain the source files and the resulting HTML browser package and is excluded from this repository.

The images show one of the Windows Software programs running, the executable included is a demo version of the full program.
