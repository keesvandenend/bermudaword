  	Reading offers you the most new words possible and in context of a story.
  	Bermuda Word e-books make this a fast experience because of the immediate correct translation.
  	Repetition and Spaced Repetition in particular make sure you remember these new words.
  	Both methods combined are by far the fastest and easiest way to learn a language.

  	Looking up words with mouse-over manual pop-up translation is 10 to 100 times faster than other methods.
  	Even selecting words with a dictionary plugin is 10 times slower than just hovering over them,
  	and with Bermuda Word e-books the manually added translation is correct and in context.
  	Repeating words a certain number of times memorizes them.
  	Repeating them with a spaced interval instead of cramming turns out to have a positive long term effect.
  	So the repetition based word testing included in the e-book software also makes it very effective.
  	Learn 100% of many more new words in 10% of the time. 
  	<B>Extensive reading with pop-up translation and spaced repetition of new words
  	are a powerful combination and the best and most fun tool to learn a new language.</B>
