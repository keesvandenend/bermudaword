  	Click on words to add them to 'My Words' list.
  	If <B>Teachermode</B> is set to <B>ON</B>, you can only see the meaning of a word by clicking on it,
  	so it will be added to 'My Words' automatically for practice purposes.
  	With <B>Teachermode</B> set to <B>ON</B> words will be removed from your 'My Words' list if you test them a specific number of times.
        The list in 'My Words' must be empty before you can finish or unlock a chapter on your <B>Progress</B> page.
        Mind that the option 'Add clicked words...' is selected if you want to add words to your wordlist even if they occur more times than the retention factor in the text.
        In theory you don't have to learn these words as they occur often enough in the text and you will meet and learn them while reading!

  	Give the unknown words a permanent place in your memory by running the 'My Words' tests.
  	In <B>Teachermode</B>, words will be removed from 'My Words' list after a (per word) specific number of successful tests.
  	If you finish the chapter read it again and click any unknown words, and re-test these again.
  	As said above, the list in 'My Words' must be empty before you can finish or unlock a chapter on your <B>Progress</B> page.
  	Testing with <B>Teachermode OFF</B> does NOT remove words from your 'My Words' list.
  	With help of the Spaced Repetition you can add a reminder for word testing,
  	so that memorizing is even more efficient.
