  	Learning to read a foreign language through graded readers or dual language books with large texts is called <B>Extensive Reading</B>.
  	It turns out that only a percentage of new words encountered is retained.
  	Research shows words are remembered after <B>5 to 20 meetings</B>, which we will call the <B>Retention Factor</B>.
  	This means you have to encounter the unknown word and look up its meaning a certain number of times to imprint it on your memory.
  	<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Bermuda Word</B></FONT> makes <B>Intensive Reading</B> of large texts possible.
  	Graded texts are offered with a pop-up <B>manual translation</B> that is <B>in context</B> and in the <B>correct conjugation</B>.
  	The program will make sure words that are looked up are stored for practice.
  	These words subsequently have to be tested a specifically calculated number of times.
  	Repeating words using a spaced interval is best for memorizing new words.
  	You can just run word tests enough times, or you can use the spaced interval system to give yourself a reminder.
